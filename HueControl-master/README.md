HueControl
==========

Java-based framework for working with the Phillips Hue system. Uses Jackson to convert responses/requests to objects,
all of which are in tachoknight.wantstobe.anearlyriser.model. I'm pretty sure I got everything that the API
supports. 

As of right now the models exist but I haven't actually put the framework together, been playing with
the lights :P

Checkout App.java in src/main/java to see how it can be used (so far).
